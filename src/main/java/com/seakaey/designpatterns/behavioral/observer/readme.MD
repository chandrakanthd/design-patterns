Concept — Observer Pattern

Definition:

The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects,
so that when one object (the Subject) changes state,
all its dependents (Observers) are notified automatically.

In simple terms:

When something changes in one object → automatically notify all interested parties.

Real-World Example: YouTube Channel Notifications

Imagine you subscribe to a YouTube channel.

The Channel (Publisher) is the Subject.

The Subscribers are the Observers.

When the channel uploads a new video, all subscribers get notified — you don’t have to check manually.

Easy Way to Remember

Observer = “Publish–Subscribe” model.

When something changes → notify everyone who’s watching.

Bonus Analogy

Think of WhatsApp groups:

The group is the Subject.

All members are Observers.

When one person sends a message, everyone gets notified instantly.
